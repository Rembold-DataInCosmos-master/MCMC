# Homework 5: MCMC Techniques

Alongside your partner, your task is to write 3 short computational essays, answering the 3 questions on this assignment. Please export each essay as a **standalone** HTML file with names like: `Problem1.html`, `Problem2.html`, etc. The HTML needs to be standalone so that all images are embedded within it, as otherwise I could not see them if you only uploaded the HTML.

There are some extra parts to problem 2 available on this assignment, which you can do for extra credit if so inspired. It will count for the same amount of points as a usual problem.

Data for each problem is contained in the `/data` folder, and should be in a format that you can easily import into your scripting language of choice.
